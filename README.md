# JkpgCity-Project

## Introduction

This is a fullstack web application built using modern technologies:

- Docker for containerization
- React for the frontend UI
- Node.js for the backend API
- MongoDB for the database

The frontend, backend and database all run in separate Docker containers, allowing for modular development and scaling.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Install Docker
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `docker-compose up`

This will start the frontend, backend and MongoDB containers.

The frontend will be available at <http://localhost:3000> and the backend API at <http://localhost:3001>.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React and provides a user interface for viewing and interacting with data from the backend API.

## Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express. It handles API requests from the frontend and interfaces with the MongoDB database.

## Database

MongoDB is used as a flexible, scalable NoSQL database to store all data for the application.

## Conclusion

This project shows how to build a fullstack web app using Docker, React, Node.js and MongoDB. It follows modern practices for containerization, modularity and scalability.
